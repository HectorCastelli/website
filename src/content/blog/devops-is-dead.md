Software development is a complicated topic. For years, industry leaders debate regarding which philosophies, practices and processes can be adopted to increase the chances of achieving success.

Out of the multitude, two fairly popular contenders seem to be strong opposites: DevOps and Platform teams. While both take a stance regarding some aspects of team shape and company structure, they seem to recommend incompatible solutions.

## A little more about them

Before we continue exploring the topic, let's take a moment to define what we are discussing.

### DevOps

DevOps is a philosophy that recommends a cyclical approach to software development, where a team builds, deploys, and monitors an application, learning from these activities in order to plan their next cycle of changes.

It emphasizes high-autonomy (and responsibility) of teams, with the understanding that all activities that the team engages in drive the learnings required to improve both the application and the health of the team itself.

### Platforms

Platforms recommend centralizing knowledge and expertise in specialized teams, then leveraging these centers of excellence to accelerate the activities of other teams.

The centralized nature of platforms serve to remove the burden of decision-making, learning, operating, and monitoring out of the individual teams. It also facilitates standardization across a company.

## Two faces of the same problem

Like so many other trends in the industry, these two create problems that the other seemingly solves. As companies apply them, the pendular nature of these practices start swinging from one extreme into the other. And then back again.

However, unlike other similarly pendular trends, the forces that energize this motion are not products of the software craft. They are related to the environment in which software development is practiced, specifically, commercially-driven software development.

Yes. This is *yet* another one of my articles where economics slither into the conversation.


The point where "released" was has moved from "before the ops teams handles it" to "before the platform handles it"

Platforms are now hailed as the one-stop solution for speed problems with software delivery, but the promises are the same as devops.... is it all a lie? Probably.

Concept of cutting jobs by centralizing concerns (devops meant devs would absorb ops; platforms mean a group o devs deduplicates efforts accross other teams) is too tempting for companies. Software development doesnt scale in the same way as other things.
This is mostly a pipe-dream and companies should realize that software is not an assembly line, the same ideas dont apply.

However, platforms are good. And so is devops. The key is balance between "size of team", "size of problem", and "expertise of team".

TODO: Make a chart and describe operating modes for the extremes of these three axis.

teams that are closer to their ops have more visibility and impact on the company and can be more responsive and responsible.

Corps that failed to implement devops will fail to implement autonomous platform teams.
