Software development is a complicated topic. For years, industry leaders debate regarding which philosophies, practices and processes can be adopted to increase the chances of achieving success.

Out of the multitude, two fairly popular contenders seem to be strong opposites: DevOps and Platform teams. While both take a stance regarding some aspects of team shape and company structure, they seem to recommend incompatible solutions.

The point where "released" was has moved from "before the ops teams handles it" to "before the platform handles it"

Platforms are now hailed as the one-stop solution for speed problems with software delivery, but the promises are the same as devops.... is it all a lie? Probably.

Concept of cutting jobs by centralizing concerns (devops meant devs would absorb ops; platforms mean a group o devs deduplicates efforts accross other teams) is too tempting for companies. Software development doesnt scale in the same way as other things.
This is mostly a pipe-dream and companies should realize that software is not an assembly line, the same ideas dont apply.

However, platforms are good. And so is devops. The key is balance between "size of team", "size of problem", and "expertise of team".

TODO: Make a chart and describe operating modes for the extremes of these three axis.

teams that are closer to their ops have more visibility and impact on the company and can be more responsive and responsible.

Corps that failed to implement devops will fail to implement autonomous platform teams.
