Software development is a complicated topic. For years, industry leaders debate regarding which philosophies, practices and processes can be adopted to increase the chances of achieving success.

Out of the multitude, two fairly popular contenders seem to be strong opposites: DevOps and Platform teams. While both take a stance regarding some aspects of team shape and company structure, they seem to recommend incompatible solutions.

## A little more about them

Before we continue exploring the topic, let's take a moment to define what we are discussing.

### DevOps

DevOps is a philosophy that recommends a cyclical approach to software development, where a team builds, deploys, and monitors an application, learning from these activities in order to plan their next cycle of changes.

It emphasizes high-autonomy (and responsibility) of teams, with the understanding that all activities that the team engages in drive the learnings required to improve both the application and the health of the team itself.

### Platforms

Platforms recommend centralizing knowledge and expertise in specialized teams, then leveraging these centers of excellence to accelerate the activities of other teams.

The centralized nature of platforms serve to remove the burden of decision-making, learning, operating, and monitoring out of the individual teams. It also facilitates standardization across a company.

## Two faces of the same problem

Like so many other trends in the industry, these two create problems that the other seemingly solves. As companies apply them, the pendular nature of these practices start swinging from one extreme into the other. And then back again.

However, unlike other similarly pendular trends, the forces that energize this motion are not products of the software craft. They are related to the environment in which software development is practiced, specifically, commercially-driven software development.

Yes. This is *yet* another one of my articles where economics slither into the conversation.

## When the pendulum swings

The things that popularize DevOps and Platforms are different in nature. In very simple terms, DevOps empowers teams to address a problem of quality, while Platforms empower organizations to address a problem of scale.

DevOps is energized when teams:

- Suffer from quality issues, due to the distance between their mistakes and the learnings that can be derived
- Suffer from delays, due to dependencies on saturated centralized teams
- Suffer from sub-optimal solutions, due to a lack of autonomy to choose the best solution for their problem
  
Platforms, on the other hand, gain traction when companies:

- Suffer to address issues across the company, like security, regulatory or legal risks
- Suffer with wasted efforts, as multiple similar solutions are created for similar problems
- Suffer with sub-optimal staffing, as multiple teams require varied expertise in multiple areas to operate

## The fallacy of the assembly line

I should probably dedicate an entire article to this aspect of software development, however, it is essential we touch upon this point before going further.

Software development is **not** a procedural activity that can be chunked and delegated to the cheapest bidder. It is a highly creative process that requires expertise and strong communication to yield results.

Treating software development like an assembly line does not work. Attempting to replace parts of the process with cookie-cutter solutions or assigning work to specialized teams may work in manufacturing, but it doesn't work for software.

Despite this being true, the economic incentives are too tempting. While the results of extreme centralization and standardization are often of lower quality, the cost involved is much lower. And due to the risky nature of software, for some companies the cost reduction justifies the drop in quality.

# So, what is the right choice?

Platform teams are now being hailed as the best solution by folks who failed to acknowledge the problem. There is no right choice, at least not without considering the multiple facets of your situation.

Because I want this article to be more than just a rant, I propose we evaluate the options along the following axis:

- size of team
- size of problem
- expertise of team

TODO: Make a chart and describe operating modes for the extremes of these three axis.

TODO: Note that most people are not in the extremes and they live in a muddled area where the pendulum swings are not only natural, they are probably the only choice.


BONUS: The extreme beyond platforms is the "just use off-the-shelf stuff", that causes a lof of other problems and is an unlikely choice.... unless you have a very low budget, and no customers, and no time, and no idea if your product will survive.


# What comes next?

Corps that failed to implement devops will fail to implement autonomous platform teams.

teams that are closer to their ops have more visibility and impact on the company and can be more responsive and responsible.

Choosing one strategy is important, but knowing why it was chosen is even more important in this case.
