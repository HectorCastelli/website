## Prioritize your efforts

Use the impact and value to strategize on which things are the most important. No need to plan them extensively, just capture their relative precedence order

Highlight the need to think beyond a singular feature

Propose managing own backlog and roadmap as a way to clearly communicate value, as well as how that allows teams to propose solutions to multiple problems at once.

Highligh how this can help make informed decisions regarding tech-debt.


## Communicate with stakeholders

Constant channels of information are needed to keep everyone involved in the loop.

Not excessive reporting, but transparency is important. This means transparency on roadmaps, metrics, and work done.

This channel is also important because enables **everyone** to share insights and refine the value-add of initiatives. Otherwise, this is pretty much waterfall.

Clarify how having a clearer picture of the value-add for each change can help on moments of crisis, when things change, or when new things need to be tackled.

## Leave room for creative solutions

Avoid prescribing solutions too early, leave your smart engineers to find oportunities to solve multiple problems at once or to revolutionize.

## Manage your tech debt wisely

Recognize that "quick fix" is a tool to be employed for a reason, but sometimes we need to go back and properly fix stuff to avoid losing velocity (or encurring risk).

## Encourage tech excellence

In line with the two previous things... encourage to do the right thing in the first place. Avoid at all cost creating a culture of "fast" before "right". That will cause problems down the line.
