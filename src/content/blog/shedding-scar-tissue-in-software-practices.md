Explore the idea that some of the standard practices for software development today come from the reaction to the ideas of the past.

Talk about how the beginning of software, where planning was closer to manufacturing, is hurting developers today, and how some processes are simply scar tissue of a time that should be forgotten.

Elaborate how agile manifesto was correct for that time, but may not be the path to the future.

Talk about collaboration, cognitive load and how we can leverage the tools of the new age (AI *wink wink*) to move at a more sustainable pace, making less mistakes, and being happier.
