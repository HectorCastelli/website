Our field has recently been involved in an uproar of *AI*-powered tools that promise to accelerate--or even replace--the parts of our jobs that we've traditionally have been trained on. 
Traditional training for software engineers puts an emphasis on syntax knowledge, data structures, and algorithms. While this knowledge is still important, the future lies elsewhere.

Regardless of the clear deficiency of the methods and materials employed to grow professions capable of writing software, tackling this educational problem won't be the main point of this article. Instead, I will explore the benefits of adopting a different mindset.

# A mindset shift

The practices and skills involved in building useful software revolve around a single sentiment: **Think about the user experience**.

While the sentiment itself is simple, the implications it brings into the entire software development lifecycle are vast. To better explore these ramifications, I will talk about the techniques and practices in three contexts: before, during, and after.

# Before

In most environments where code is written there is a significant amount of effort exercised even before a single key is pressed. In a more traditional environment, these aspects would fall under your Project Managers, Product Owners, or any other fancy title for "the person that tell us what to do".

This model is unsustainable and produces churn and rework. In the spirit of agility, we aim to shorten the feedback cycle dramatically by getting involved at this stage.

## Know your users

## Identify the value of initiatives

## Prioritize your efforts

## Communicate with your team

## Plan against complexity

# During

## Communicate with stakeholders

## Leave room for creative solutions

## Manage your tech debt wisely

## Encourage tech excellence

# After

## Understand you might not really know your user that well...
Let them talk to you and give quick feedback.



The biggest differentiator in my career has been the ability to develop software that solves real problems. I hold a strong belief that the skills involved in building useful software are what developers should focus on next. These skills revolve around a singular sentiment: **Think about the user experience**.

While this sentiment seems easy to explain, the ramifications of employing this directive in what and how you build software are the reason why this is more effective than the alternatives.

## Know your user

## Understand you don't really know your user

## Identifying value

## Think about the user experience

## Communicate effectively

### With your stakeholders
### With your team

## Leave room for creative solutions

## Manage debt wisely

## Prioritize efforts
