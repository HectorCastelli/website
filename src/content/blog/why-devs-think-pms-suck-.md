two types of company: one that uses software as tool, one where software is the product.

for those where software is the tool, initially software projects are seen as a means to an end and therefore are managed like that: a finished product that achievs something.

In reality the time it takes to build software often longer than the time it takes for business to change processes and targets. This disconnect leads to projects that deliver "too late to be useful", as well as "too expensive to fix".

PM methodologies classicly try to manage with goals and metrics, but PMs are too ignorant to come up with good metrics, and mistrust devs too much to collaborate on goals (this leads to low buy-in).

On companies where software is the product, there is no excuse. You must understand the product, or you'll help with nothing.

pm as a glue between the multiple disciplines.

Pure-business PMs suck. tech knowledge is useful. willingness to learn paramount.

Why pure-business PMs are popular? Because its easier for them to silo knowledge and hand-down orders to other disciplines.

High-churn rate and attrition makes this model attractive, but on the other hand this model causes more attrition (even on the PMs).


What to do to be better?

- share domain understanding
- learn technical minimum
- pair with devs
- communicate more
