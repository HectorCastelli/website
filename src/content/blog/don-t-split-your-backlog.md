[Humans like to categorize](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/wired-for-categorization/), and this may be the reason why we like to split things into neat buckets.

## Why splitting is bad

Lose sight of competing priorities

Fail to adapt to Conway's law, cause problems and frustrations

## Why splitting is useful

Allow you to prioritize and talk about relatively similar things

Allows for smaller groups of stakeholders to meet and negotiate priorities

## A compromise

Talk about how we should supress our instinct and merge all the backlogs.

Link to previous post about shared roadmap.

HIghlight that in the end, there are three types of things: Things that need to happen soon, things that need to happen eventually, and things that don't really need to happen.

Final note that this is not a one-off exercise and should be always evolving and re-prioritizing.
