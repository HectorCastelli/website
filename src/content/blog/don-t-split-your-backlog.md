[Humans like to categorize](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/wired-for-categorization/), and while this instinct is useful, it may need to be tamed when it comes to work.

A common anti-pattern in multidisciplinary teams is the "categorized backlog", where initiatives get placed neatly into buckets based on their characteristics. This, usually, ends up with two effects: confusion regarding the priorities of the team, and frustration when the work inevitably spills out from that theoretical neat bucket.

## Why do we still do it?

Categorizing is useful. This is, after all, the reason we started doing it. The benefits are very apparent when conversations regarding scope, relative value, and priority:

By keeping items of similar shape together, the discovery of details regarding scope, user-base, or impact is easier. The likelihood of those involved having expertise, or access to experts, greatly improves the quality of the analysis regarding work items.

Likewise, when the resources or impact required are similar, the stakeholder involved are able to hold more focused conversations when negotiating which order tasks need to be tackled by the team.

The theme is clear, working on similar items allows for better, or at least more predictable, output.

## Reaching a compromise

The key action here is to **merge regularly**, the separate backlogs that exist.

By the time this activity happens, items should be well-understood and that the headspace of those involved in merging the backlogs should be focused on deciding which items are more aligned to the goals of the project.

Finally, the merged backlog is the **only** backlog that matters when planning is a topic. Your separate backlogs are not useful for the teams executing the work, and expecting them to execute on all separate topics at the same rate should never be expected.
