[Humans like to categorize](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/wired-for-categorization/), and while this instinct is useful, it may need to be tamed when it comes to work.

A common anti-pattern in multidisciplinary teams is the "categorized backlog", where initiatives get placed neatly into buckets based on their characteristics. This, usually, ends up with two effects: confusion regarding the priorities of the team, and frustration when the work inevitably spills out from that theoretical neat bucket.

## Why do we still do it?

Categorizing is useful. This is, after all, the reason we started doing it. The benefits are very apparent when conversations regarding scope, relative value, and priority:

By keeping items of similar shape together, the discovery of details regarding scope, user-base, or impact is easier. The likelihood of those involved having expertise, or access to experts, greatly improves the quality of the analysis regarding work items.

Likewise, when the resources or impact required are similar, the stakeholder involved are able to hold more focused conversations when negotiating which order tasks need to be tackled by the team.

The theme is clear, working on similar items allows for better, or at least more predictable, output.

Lose sight of competing priorities

Fail to adapt to Conway's law, cause problems and frustrations

## How can we reconcile these two opposites?

The key action here is to merge, **regularly**, the separate backlogs that exist.

By the point this activity happens, items should be well-understood, and the effort should be used deciding the order of importance of the items relative to each other.



## A compromise

Talk about how we should supress our instinct and merge all the backlogs.

HIghlight that in the end, there are three types of things: Things that need to happen soon, things that need to happen eventually, and things that don't really need to happen.

Final note that this is not a one-off exercise and should be always evolving and re-prioritizing.
