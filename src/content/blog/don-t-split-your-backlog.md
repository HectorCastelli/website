As they scale, companies cannot rely on ad-hoc decisions for determining which pieces of work need to be executed, and in which order they should be tackled on. The common approach is to create a backlog of work items, sorted to fit the priorities and goals of the organization. This backlog is meant to clearly communicate the direction and intent of the company, and should be the guiding-star for the efforts applied.

However, as the nature of work increase in complexity, things get harder to prioritize. Since [humans like to categorize](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/wired-for-categorization/), the "categorized backlog" appears as a way to simplify the prioritization and planning of work. This anti-pattern usually appears with the creation of parallel backlogs, managed by different group of stakeholders, which cover one area or type of work. The most common appearances are the "Technical backlog" vs "Product backlog", or the classical *"one backlog per product"* approach for multi-product teams.

## Why do we split backlogs?

Categorizing is useful. This is, after all, the reason we started doing it. The benefits are very apparent when conversations regarding scope, relative value, and priority:

By keeping items of similar shape together, the discovery of details regarding scope, user-base, or impact is easier. The likelihood of those involved having expertise, or access to experts, greatly improves the quality of the analysis regarding work items.

Likewise, when the resources or impact required are similar, the stakeholder involved are able to hold more focused conversations when negotiating which order tasks need to be tackled by the team.

The theme is clear, **working on similar items allows for better, or at least more predictable, output**.

## The undesirable effects

Unfortunately, this approach has two common side-effects: confusion regarding the priorities of the team, and frustration when the work inevitably spills out from that theoretical neat bucket.

### Confusing priorities

Regardless of the intent to simplify prioritization, this is only a reality for those few involved in the organization of each backlog. The people involved in executing the pieces of work, however, still have the entire backlog to process.

Simply put, this way of working is **statistically less effective**: The majority of the people inside the organization are unclear regarding priorities and objectives.

Additionally, this contributes to inequity. Those responsible for the work are unclear on the priorities that those accountable will ultimately judge them on. For most, this environment is toxic and encourage avoidance of responsibilities and less risk-taking.

### Scope-change frustrations

The inevitable truth is that time is limited. As time passes, and promised deadlines are broken, teams are pushed into further stress. The separation of the backlogs caused important conversations to happen late, or not at all.

By the time priorities start to be clarified, teams have already tried to appease multiple "first-priority" items, suffering as each stakeholder ensures that their first priority is the *firstest* between the bunch.

This leads to broken -poisoned by the inconsistency- communications regarding priorities. Your teams are conditioned to **never believe** something is a first-priority.

## How to **not** fix the problem

An approach commonly seem to try to solve the problem is to start assigning "quotas" to each backlog, with the hopes of simplifying how teams tackle the multiple items that are workeable.

**Don't do this**. This approach relies on the misconception that multitasking works, but it doesn't: [1](https://hbr.org/2010/12/you-cant-multi-task-so-stop-tr), [2](https://brainfodder.org/multi-tasking-doesnt-work/), [3](https://www.betterup.com/blog/multitasking), [4](https://www.forbes.com/sites/douglasmerrill/2012/08/17/why-multitasking-doesnt-work/).

## What to do instead?

As we've established, there are *some* benefits to discussing work items between smaller audiences that have expertise to make decisions regarding them. However, these benefits become statistically insignificant once they need to be communicated to the rest of the company.

To this end, one action needs to be taken: **Merge and reconcile the multiple backlogs regularly**.

Importantly, by the time this activity happens, items should be well-understood and the headspace of those involved should be focused on deciding which items are more aligned to the goals of the project, not discovering what the work entails or how it could contribute to the organization objectives.

### What if things don't fit?

After these discussions, some items may simply not be feasible within the initial time-frame.

Be reassured, this is not a deficiency of your efforts to merge the backlogs. It simply highlights the reality of the matter: the initial expectation were not realistic and did not take into account the reality of the works that needs to be done.

## Final notes

Finally, the merged backlog is the **only** backlog that matters. Your separate backlogs are not useful for the teams executing the work, and expecting them to execute on all separate topics at the same rate should never be expected.

By all means, keep splitting into smaller, focused, groups to discuss and discover the necessary information. Just don't forget to merge.

Notes:

What happens when business doesn't agree on priorities:
- Team will try to risk-manage and take the least risky options and keep themselves safe instead of focusing on business value.
- "What happens when you have too many initiatives in the backlog"?
- Not only look at priorities for your team, also check other teams, because things may impact you as well.
