## The rise of planners

When brick-and-mortar companies first discovered the power of computing they saw the opportunity to leverage software for the only thing that matters to companies: making more money. By leveraging this sleepless machination capable to pushing data to all corners of the world, locality was no longer a problem. Scaling operations across the globe, running business at all hours, and even automating repetitive tasks became within reach. It is in this gold-rush of information that the software development lifecycle practices and tools we use today originated. However, while we learned a lot in some areas, others are more or less the same...

One of the constants is, to the surprise of none, the search for ways to make software in a cost-effective way. Nowadays, the common wisdom to achieve this goal is to rely on a variety of roles and disciplines that collaborate together to make software. One such role, whose sole responsibility is keeping the flow of work unimpeded, is the "planner". You may know them as Product/Programme/Project managers, SCRUM masters, or "that guy with the Gantt chart". Regardless of the name, they are the ones that usually guide the efforts of others.

## Types of software projects

When you analyze software based on the goals of the organizations that birthed them, you find two broad categories: Software as a tool, and software as a product.

Going back to our old-school businesses, the creation of software has, historically, been a means to an end. In these organizations, the software is usually created to enable or enhance business capabilities to help it make its product more profitable. These companies are the majority.

On the other end of the spectrum, you have organizations that make their entire product offerings with software. Funnily enough, they often sell process-enhancing tools to the other group. Think of all the SaaS contracts that float around the industry.

## The dictatorship of planners

In the eternal pursuit of effectiveness, some decided to shrink the informed forum as much as possible, possibly to concentrate expertise and expedite decision-making. Those select few would then be responsible for leading the rest across the perilous minefield that is building useful software.

Centralizing information, thinning communication lines, blocking outside influences, and monitoring others for unknown purposes; Planners have become evil dictators.

Maybe this wasn't the intent. Maybe it was born out of a desire to protect their team's precious time. Or maybe it was born from a lack of trust in the decision-making skills of the diverse mass. Regardless of the intent, the oppressed resent it.

## A problem of the majority

Just like other rant-induced (and perhaps cathartic) essays you see published across the industry, these problems are present on the majority of engagements. Not *all*, just *most*.





This leads to a team of people that:

- **Don't understand what they are building**, because they lack the domain knowledge;
- **Don't care about being effective**, because they are ????
- **Don't care about the finished product**, because they don't understand nor believe in it;


In reality the time it takes to build software often longer than the time it takes for business to change processes and targets. This disconnect leads to projects that deliver "too late to be useful", as well as "too expensive to fix".

PM methodologies classicly try to manage with goals and metrics, but PMs are too ignorant to come up with good metrics, and mistrust devs too much to collaborate on goals (this leads to low buy-in).

On companies where software is the product, there is no excuse. You must understand the product, or you'll help with nothing.

pm as a glue between the multiple disciplines.

Pure-business PMs suck. tech knowledge is useful. willingness to learn paramount.

Why pure-business PMs are popular? Because its easier for them to silo knowledge and hand-down orders to other disciplines.

High-churn rate and attrition makes this model attractive, but on the other hand this model causes more attrition (even on the PMs).


What to do to be better?

- share domain understanding
- learn technical minimum
- pair with devs
- communicate more
