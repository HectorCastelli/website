# A little about me...

I'm a curious technologist with a love for results. That is to say that, despite my love for tech and the puzzles involved, I take greater pride in accomplishing things and providing value.

I bring a diverse skill set, a passion for learning, and a healthy dose of laziness to make sure time is not wasted. I love learning new things, and I don't shy away from challenges.
